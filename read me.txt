I recommend to run the following three .m files one by one to understand the automated figure results better.
(1)	ECG_pipline.m, it shows the analysis pipeline and plot detailed results on one lead ECG signals.
(2)	ECG_batch_process.m, it shows the batch processing of four subjects, only important results are plot.
(3)	results_statistic.m, it pool-over 4*4 activities HRs so that some statistic analysis can be done here.

Before you run m files, Notice:
(1) the 16 excel files should be put under the folder 'files', they are too large to send by email.
(2) check the MATLABdir in the head of each .m file, change it to your own folder path for MATLAB.

BTW, somehow, I found that the ECG of 'x' activity of four subjects are the same. I was wondering is it a test or a mistake by accident?
